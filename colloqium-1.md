## Notes (9/17)

### Bazerman Article
Question of whether or not there can be a rhetoric of technology (uses comparisons with the rhetoric of science)

Science and technology as the same but also very different

Rhetoric and science as an oxymoron and a tautology (pg. 382-383) - (Q1)

**Oxymoron:** a phrase that combines two words that are opposites of each other (e.g., jumbo shrimp)

**Tautology:** the use of different words to say the same thing twice in a single statement

How science can work through people, who are faulty and imprecise, and still be considered factual and a means of stable decision

Same idea with technology. Technology works until it doesn't. For example, computer systems. They do things perfectly (e.g., calculations, equations) until they make a mistake, which is a result of being made by people, who are inherently faulty

Yes, there can be a rhetoric of technology. It's "the rhetoric of all the discourses that surround and embed technology" (Q2)

Rhetoric of different discourses - politics, law, language, all in one medium.

### McLuhan Article

How technology has changed how we interact with one another - pg. 12 (Q1) main issue

Medium is the message - we used to think the message is important, but it's actually how the medium (e.g, laptop or piece of paper or VR) influences that message and how it's percieved

Content of the medium can distract us and then the first message becomes invisible (e.g., social media versus the story)

Televised debates - presidential debate, the content of their message is irrelevant, it's actually how they articulate and master the medium that they are aware of (e.g., television)

"Today when we want to get our bearings in our own culture, and have need to stand aside from the bias and pressure exerted by any technical form of human expression, we have only to visit a society where that particular form has not been felt, or a historical period in which it was unknown." (pg. 13) (Q2)

Be mindful of how technology impacts the message.
