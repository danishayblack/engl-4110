## "The Production of Technology and the Production of Human Meaning" by Charles Bazerman

Begins with series of questions about rhetoric, and technology

Edison and the symbolic, representational, and rhetorical work that came with the lightbulb - "rhetorical productions that surround material technology."

Material as in physical, handheld

Tammany Hall (note- the main political machine of liberals in NYC)

Specific studies of rhetoric within disciplines (such as rhetoric within politics, there is also a rhetoric within technology) - how is technology used as rhetoric?

Rhetoric: the effective and persuasuasive use of language or other faculties to persuade

Question of whether or not there can be a rhetoric of technology

### Three Key Distinctions
1. Identification of fields
2. Degree of enclosure that bounds the fields
3. The effect of materiality on the symbolic activity

Constant compare and contrast of rhetoric of science and rhetoric of technology.

Rhetoric and science as a tautology and oxymoron (i.e., how science can work through faulty human means and emotions and can still be considered factual and stable)

Science as distinct from rhetoric. Though is this actually the case? Science can be a means of persuasion.

Technology is a part of commerece, finances, customers, vendors, partnerships, and corporations. Technology has always been designed to fulfill a human need

Science as enclosed and specialized communication system.

Science as staying inward - constantly reviwed and analyzed. Technology as outward-facing.

Science produces claims as an end product (e.g., mathematical, graphic, verbal symbols) - entire project becomes rhetorical because of the call to examine all of the language

Technology ciruclates objects and material processes and not words. The technology is a physical "obduracy"

Obduracy: diffcult to change or deal with. Persistent in wrongdoing

The rhetoric of technology is the "rhetoric that accompanies technology and makes it possible--the rhetroci that makes technology fit into the world and makes the world fit with technology."

Technology is made to fit in.

Why is the rhetoric of technology important? Is it more important than the rhetoric of science or other fields?

Rhetoric of technology shows how objects put into an environment become part of our system

Effective technology is something you don't even realize is there. It's only when technology begins to fail that we recognize its presence in our lives.

How often does technology fail? Are there times where we can choose to ignore its failures as a part of our system?

The rhetoric of technology as "the rhetoric of all the discourses that surround and embed technology"

By understanding the rhetoric of technology (which is embedded with other fields such as law, science, politics) we can understand and regain choices about the "technological future we live in."

The nature of technology is rhetorical because so many other fields are apart of it (e.g., science)
