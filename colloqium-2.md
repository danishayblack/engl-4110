# Colloqium 2

## Notes (10/8)

**Quotes that express the effect of technology**

* "This logic turns ordinary life into the daily renewal of a twenty-first-century Faustian compact. “Faustian” because it is nearly impossible to tear ourselves away, despite the fact that what we must give in return will destroy life as we have known it."
* "Surveillance capitalism is a rogue force driven by novel economic imperatives that disregard social norms and nullify the elemental rights associated with individual autonomy that are essential to the very possibility of a democratic society."
* "If it's free you are the product."

**How do virtual things affect us in the real world?**
For example, it affects how we interact with the idea of home. Home as a safe place versus a place that we continue to be watched and sold to. Profit-making incentive for companys.

**Noble Reading** 
How they influence our go-to thoughts. When you see something you have the initial response and then what you think after. The initial response is what you've been "programed" to think first. An algorithm can change your initial response. (e.g., trans women always linked with Olympics or sports, idea of unfair winning, how long until a term becomes linked with the controversies surrounding it).

Technology has leaked into everything that we do. How we treat it and how we develop it. 

Why do we treat it like it is a force of nature instead of a tool that people are using?

**Other Notes**
* Collection of data, must agree to terms-of-service. Can't use if you don't agree to them collecting your information.
* Surveillance Capitalism no longer contained to companies. Now the default model for most internet based images.
