# Colloqium 2

## Notes (10/8)

**Quotes that express the effect of technology**

* "This logic turns ordinary life into the daily renewal of a twenty-first-century Faustian compact. “Faustian” because it is nearly impossible to tear ourselves away, despite the fact that what we must give in return will destroy life as we have known it."
* "Surveillance capitalism is a rogue force driven by novel economic imperatives that disregard social norms and nullify the elemental rights associated with individual autonomy that are essential to the very possibility of a democratic society."
* "If it's free you are the product."
* "Are we all going to be working for a smart machine, or will we have smart people around the machine?"

**How do virtual things affect us in the real world?**
For example, it affects how we interact with the idea of home. Home as a safe place versus a place that we continue to be watched and sold to. Profit-making incentive for companys.

**Noble Reading** 
How they influence our go-to thoughts. When you see something you have the initial response and then what you think after. The initial response is what you've been "programed" to think first. An algorithm can change your initial response. (e.g., trans women always linked with Olympics or sports, idea of unfair winning, how long until a term becomes linked with the controversies surrounding it).

Technology has leaked into everything that we do. How we treat it and how we develop it. 

Why do we treat it like it is a force of nature instead of a tool that people are using?

**Other Notes**
* Collection of data, must agree to terms-of-service. Can't use if you don't agree to them collecting your information.
* Surveillance Capitalism no longer contained to companies. Now the default model for most internet based images.

## Notes (10/10)

**Zoboff**

* Selling us something so that they can collect our data (e.g., social media app)
* We are the resource. Model of capitalism is to exploit the resources until they are gone and then try to optimize what is left.
* Dependance on technology (e.g., cars, phones, etc.) surveillance system a problem caused by people.
* "Surveillance capitalists know everything about us, whereas their operations are designed to be unknowable to us."
* "A distinct new planet with its own physics." Cannot be grasped with existing concepts through current language.
* Parallels of "1984" by George Orwell. Idea of constant surveillance not a novel idea.
* It's the effect of technology that is important, not the technology itself.
* Introduction of anti-monopolistic laws, but surveillance has exploded and so we are continuously marketed to (e.g., Spotify is constantly marketing to you based on what you are listening to. Emailing you about events of your favorite artists showing in your area).

**Baudrillard**

* "What society seeks through production, and overproduction, is the restoration of the real which escapes it."
* *Hyperreal* is something that never existed in the first place but is made to be a representation. Simulation of something without a reference to something that is actually real.
* Physical material world that is familiar, but simulations of it that try to replicate it are scaled-down versions. This is what destroys the real itself. These simulations, the hyperreal, destroys the actual real (e.g., Tomorrowland)
* "When the real is no longer what it used to be, nostalgia assumes its full meaning."
* Phases: 1) reflection of basic reality, 2) masks and perverts basic reality, 3) masks the absence of basic reality, 4) bears no relation to any reality and is its own thing
* Dissimulation: to feign what one hasn't (e.g., faking an illness)
* Can see outward but don't give away knowledge of what they are
* Second-hand truth, objectivity, and authenticity. Baudrillard's reaction to things like media and how it affects and changes things like politics. A fearful response. Sad for what was lost. Like the old adage, "You don't know what you had until it's gone."
